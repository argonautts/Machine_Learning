- - Logistic Regression
- - K Nearest Neighbors
- - Decision Trees
- - Random Forests
- - AdaBoost, GradientBoosting
- - Natural Language Processing
- - K Means Clustering

- - PCA - Principal Component Analysis
- - etc.


## Setup
#### Installing Python

Make sure that you have [Python installed](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) on your machine. I am using Python version 3.10.

You might want to use [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) standard Python library
to create virtual environments and have Python, `pip` and all dependent packages to be installed and 
served from the local project directory to avoid messing with system-wide packages and their 
versions.

#### Installing Dependencies

Install all dependencies that are required for the project by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Launching Jupyter Locally

All demos in the project may be run directly in your browser without installing Jupyter locally. But if you want to launch [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) locally you may do it by running the following command from the root folder of the project:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
After this Jupyter Notebook will be accessible by `http://localhost:8888`.
